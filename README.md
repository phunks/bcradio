### ‚ö† About building and running on Linux üêß

This program uses [rustaudio/cpal](https://github.com/rustaudio/cpal) lib to play audio, which requires ALSA development files on Linux.

In order to build and run this program on Linux, you need to installÔºö

- `libasound2-dev` on Debian / Ubuntu
- `alsa-lib-devel` on Fedora

If AAAA records are returned slowly in the information screen, add "options single-request-reopen" to resolve.conf. It is not my fault.

### ‚ö† About running on Windows

The program can also play audio using the [ASIO4ALL](https://asio4all.org) driver instead of WASAPI.
